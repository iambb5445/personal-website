description: Marching cubes is an algorithm to extract a mesh from a 3D scalar field. By giving a 3D scalar field (called volumetric data in this implementation) as an input, it will generate the mesh data for that shape in a custom format. This project is an efficient implementation of this algorithm based on the Transvoxel Algorithm described in the Foundations of Game Engine Development book by Eric Lengyl.
